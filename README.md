# Sport Education System Using AI and ML 🧠⚽

An intelligent system aimed at revolutionizing sports education by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide data-driven insights, personalized coaching, and performance prediction.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Sport Education System is designed to enhance the learning, training, and performance analysis experience for athletes, students, and coaches. Using AI and ML models, this system analyzes sports data to deliver:

- Player performance prediction
- Personalized training programs
- Real-time feedback
- Injury risk analysis
- Skill-based assessments

## 🧩 Key Features

- ⚡ **AI/ML Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and Regression techniques for performance prediction.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Insights via charts and graphs (using PowerBI/Matplotlib).
- 🏋️ **Personalized Coaching**: Tailored suggestions based on player data and progress.
- 🏃 **Fitness & Skill Tracker**: Analyzes physical and technical performance over time.
- 📁 **Modular Architecture**: Clean, scalable backend and frontend structure.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React)
- **Backend**: javaScript, Nodejs, 
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Python
- **Data Visualization**: PowerBI / Matplotlib / Seaborn
